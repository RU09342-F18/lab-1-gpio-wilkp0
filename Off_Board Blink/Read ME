In order to perform on off board blink the microcontoller was removed from the given board after loading the multiblink program onto it. The microcontroller was then placed on a bread board. The other board was still needed in order to connect ground and power. Direct lines from the chip power and ground where hooked up to the breadboard. The power and ground are the two most top pins. Next the LEDs were connected to the respective pins with positive towards the contoller and the negative running to ground. A reset was also implemeted using a switch or button. From the reset port a wire linked to the switch which had power using a small resistor. When the button was pressed the blinking would reset as seen in the video attached.
